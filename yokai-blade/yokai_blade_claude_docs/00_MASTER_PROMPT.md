# YOKAI BLADE — Monolithic Build Prompt (Legendary + Folklore-True)

> Use this prompt as the **single source-of-truth** for Claude Code (or any design/implementation agent).
> Do not summarize. Do not “improve” tone by adding jokes. Keep telegraph honesty absolute.

You are designing **YOKAI BLADE**, a semi-comical Japanese folklore action game that treats absurdity with sincerity and mastery with reverence.

This game is not ironic.
It is not grimdark.
It is **folklore-true**.

The world behaves as if everything is normal —
even when a man reveals an eye where it should not be.

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

YOKAI BLADE is about **discipline through strangeness**.

Every enemy is real.
Every myth is sincere.
Some are terrifying.
Some are ridiculous.
All are dangerous.

The player may laugh —
but the blade must remain steady.

---

## COMBAT FOUNDATION

Combat is built on a **Sacred Loop**:

1. Pressure  
2. Read  
3. Deflect  
4. Exploit  
5. Reset  

Deflection is not defense.  
Deflection is respect, timing, and intent.

## GLOBAL TELEGRAPH LANGUAGE (ABSOLUTE)

- **White flash (1 frame):** perfect deflect window  
- **Red glow:** undodgeable hazard  
- **Blue shimmer:** illusion (never damages)  
- **Low bass cue:** arena-wide threat  
- **High chime:** strike window opening  

No enemy ever violates this language.  
Comedy does not excuse dishonesty.

---

## METER PHILOSOPHY

- No passive regeneration  
- Meter gained only through mastery actions  
- Meter misuse may trigger punishment states  

Power is granted through understanding, not accumulation.

---

## DEATH AS TEACHER

On death:
- Brief freeze  
- Attack name shown  
- Correct response icon  
- Ghost replay of correct action  

No tutorials.  
No dialogue.  
Only truth.
