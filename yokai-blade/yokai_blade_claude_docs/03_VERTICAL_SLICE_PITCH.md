# YOKAI BLADE — Publisher-Ready Vertical Slice Pitch (Shirime → Tanuki → Oni)

## Slice Overview

- **Slice Name:** The Three Trials  
- **Duration:** 45–60 minutes  
- **Goal:** Prove tonal range, mechanical clarity, and mastery-first combat

This slice demonstrates how YOKAI BLADE balances reverent folklore, controlled humor, and high-skill combat without compromising clarity or difficulty.

## Why This Slice

Three consecutive fights present three philosophies of combat:

1. **Restraint** (Shirime)  
2. **Discernment** (Tanuki)  
3. **Mastery** (Oni)  

Together they prove: the game can be strange and funny while remaining lethal and honest.

## Boss 1 — Shirime (Etiquette Trial)

- **Tone:** Quietly absurd, sincere, unsettling  
- **Core Lesson:** Patience; read before strike  
- **Hook:** A polite man who waits. Attacking too soon is punished; waiting creates the opening.

**Why it matters:** Immediately communicates confidence, folklore authenticity, and a “show-don’t-tell” teaching style.

## Transition — The Trickster Road

The environment destabilizes subtly (visual inconsistencies, misplaced cues, statues slightly wrong) to prime suspicion without explanation.

## Boss 2 — Tanuki (Deception Trial)

- **Tone:** Playful but dangerous  
- **Core Lesson:** Pattern > appearance; assumptions kill  
- **Hook:** Familiar shapes and false forms. Telegraph syntax remains honest; visuals mislead.

**Why it matters:** Demonstrates system integrity: the player learns to trust the global telegraph language rather than surface presentation.

## Transition — Gate of Jigoku

All illusions drop. Ambience collapses. The path straightens. An inscription reads:
> “When tricks end, skill remains.”

## Boss 3 — Oni (Truth Trial)

- **Tone:** Severe, honorable  
- **Core Lesson:** Pure execution  
- **Hook:** Empty arena. No hazards. No gimmicks. You or the Oni.

**Why it matters:** Proves the combat system stands alone, delivering a final “thesis defense” that validates the entire design.

## What This Slice Proves Commercially

- Clear, differentiated identity vs. action-roguelike/spectacle trends
- Honest difficulty with readable telegraphs (strong stream/watch value)
- Long-tail mastery potential (speedruns, challenge runs, community discourse)
- Folklore tone that is memorable and marketable without irony

## Audience

- Action mastery players
- Folklore/myth enthusiasts
- Streamers who value readable difficulty
- Players who enjoy games that teach without tutorials

## One-line Pitch

**YOKAI BLADE is a folklore action game where even the jokes can kill you — and every victory feels earned.**
