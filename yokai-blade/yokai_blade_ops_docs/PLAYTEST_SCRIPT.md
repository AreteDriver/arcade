# Playtest Script (Signal-Only Feedback)

## Rules for the session
- Do not explain mechanics.
- Do not give hints unless the tester is truly stuck for 10+ minutes.
- Record: audio level, input device, fps.

## Questions (ask after each death cluster)
1) What killed you? (their words)
2) What did you think you were supposed to do?
3) Did you miss it because of timing, or because you assumed wrong?
4) Did audio help you? Which sound did you rely on?
5) Did anything feel like it lied?

## What to ignore (for now)
- “Add a difficulty slider”
- “Make it more like X game”
- “Add more effects/juice”
- Cosmetic opinions not tied to readability

## Success definition
A tester can explain failure within ~1 second even if they can’t execute yet.
