You must not tune against chaos. Establish placeholders early.

## VFX Placeholders (3)
- WhiteFlash_1f (Perfect Deflect semantic)
- RedGlow_Area (Undodgeable hazard semantic)
- BlueShimmer (Illusion semantic)

## SFX Placeholders (5)
- SFX_Telegraph_WhiteFlash
- SFX_Telegraph_LowBassThreat
- SFX_StrikeWindow_Chime
- SFX_Deflect_Perfect
- SFX_PlayerHit

## Music Placeholders (3)
- Silence (Shirime pre-commit)
- TricksterPulse (Tanuki; playful but not comedic)

- Telegraph SFX must be audible on laptop speakers
- Telegraph SFX must survive stream compression
