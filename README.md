# Machine Shop of Tomorrow 🔧⚡

A physics sandbox game where kids discover, fix, and invent fantastical machines of the future.

## Concept

Kids encounter amazing machines — a Breakfast Bot, a Cloud Harvester, a Dream Recorder — that are broken, miscalibrated, or incomplete. They learn how components work by fixing them, then use those components to invent their own impossible machines in sandbox mode.

Every machine is a chain of interconnected components with real physics. Tweak speed, direction, and flow, then watch reactions ripple through the system.

## Game Modes

**Discovery Mode** — Pre-built machines across 4 themed worlds (16 levels). Fix broken machines, calibrate outputs, fill in missing pieces, and stabilize overloaded systems.

**Inventor Mode** — Free-form sandbox. Build anything from unlocked components. Save and revisit your creations.

## Tech Stack

- **Engine:** Godot 4.3+
- **Language:** GDScript
- **Platform:** Android (primary), iOS (stretch)
- **Target:** Kids 6-12
