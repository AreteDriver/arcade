**EVE Rebellion** is a collection of arcade shooters set in the EVE Online universe. Experience pivotal moments in New Eden's history through fast-paced vertical shooter gameplay.

## Campaigns

### Elder Fleet Invasion (YC110)
*Minmatar vs Amarr — 13 stages*

Rise from a rookie pilot in a rusty Rifter to an ace liberator in a Jaguar. Join the Elder Fleet as they emerge from decades of hiding to free the Minmatar people from centuries of Amarr slavery.

### Battle of Caldari Prime (YC115)
*Caldari vs Gallente — 5 missions + Endless Mode*

Choose your side in the battle that changed Caldari Prime forever. Fight as Caldari State defending Shiigeru, or Gallente Federation liberating the planet. Includes **Shiigeru Nightmare** — an endless survival mode aboard the dying Titan.

### Triglavian Invasion *(In Development)*
*EDENCOM vs Triglavian Collective — 9 missions*

Defend New Eden from the Triglavian invasion, or embrace the Flow and fight for Pochven. Choose EDENCOM to protect the empires, or join the Collective to claim systems for Pochven.
