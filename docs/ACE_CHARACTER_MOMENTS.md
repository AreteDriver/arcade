    # Get appropriate shout
    victory_shout = get_ace_victory_shout(performance, ship_tier)
    
    # Display with appropriate styling
    display_victory_message(victory_shout, 
                          size="LARGE" if performance == "excellent" else "medium",
                          color=GOLD if ship_tier == 0 else SILVER,
                          animation="explode" if performance == "excellent" else "slide")
    
    # Audio
    play_voice_line(f"victory_{ship_tier}_{performance}.ogg")
```
